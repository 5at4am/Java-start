 * File: Twice.java
 * Description: This program checks if there are duplicate elements in an array.
 * Author: Satyam Raj
 * Date: October 2025
 * 
 * Purpose: This program demonstrates how to:
 * - Check for duplicate elements in an array using nested loops
 * - Implement a function that returns a boolean value
 * - Use nested for loops to compare all pairs of elements
 * - Return true as soon as a duplicate is found
 * - Return false if no duplicates are found after checking all pairs
 * - Properly close Scanner resources
 * 
 * Algorithm: Nested loop approach
 * - Compare each element with all subsequent elements
 * - Return true immediately when a duplicate is found
 * - Time complexity: O(nÂ²), Space complexity: O(1)
 * 
 * Note: For better performance with large arrays, consider using a HashSet
 * which would give O(n) time complexity.
