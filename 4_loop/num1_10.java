 * Description: This program prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
 * Author: Satyam Raj
 * Date: October 2025
 * 
 * Purpose: This program demonstrates how to:
 * - Initialize a counter variable
 * - Use a while loop with a condition
 * - Print numbers in sequence
 * - Increment the counter to avoid infinite loops
 * - Format output with spaces between numbers

// Simple loop counting: The foundation of many algorithms!
// Fun fact: While loops are useful when you don't know in advance how many times you'll loop!
