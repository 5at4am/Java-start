 * File: Q3.java
 * Description: This program calculates the total cost of three items, including GST (Goods and Services Tax).
 * Author: Satyam Raj
 * Date: October 2025
 * 
 * Purpose: This program demonstrates how to:
 * - Take floating-point input from the user using Scanner
 * - Perform arithmetic operations with decimal numbers
 * - Calculate tax (18% GST in this example)
 * - Compute final total with tax included
 * - Format and display financial calculations
 * - Properly close Scanner resources to prevent resource leaks
 * 
 * Tax calculation: GST = cost Ã— 0.18
 * Final total = original cost + GST
