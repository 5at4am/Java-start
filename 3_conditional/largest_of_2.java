 * File: LargestOf2.java
 * Description: This program compares two hardcoded numbers to determine which is larger.
 * Author: Satyam Raj
 * Date: October 2025
 * 
 * Purpose: This program demonstrates how to:
 * - Compare two integer values using conditional statements
 * - Implement basic if-else logic
 * - Output the result of a comparison operation
 * 
 * Logic implemented:
 * - Compare two hardcoded values (a=12, b=13)
 * - Print the larger value

// It's often said that the best way to find the larger of two numbers is to compare them!
// Fun fact: This simple comparison is the foundation for more complex sorting algorithms!
