 * File: Q4.java
 * Description: This program demonstrates the use of ternary operators with hardcoded values.
 * Author: Satyam Raj
 * Date: October 2025
 * 
 * Purpose: This program demonstrates how to:
 * - Use ternary (conditional) operators for boolean assignment
 * - Use ternary operators for numeric assignment
 * - Compare hardcoded integer values
 * - Print the results of ternary operations
 * 
 * Operations demonstrated:
 * - Boolean assignment using ternary: (a < b) ? true : false
 * - Numeric assignment using ternary: (a > b) ? a : b

// Ternary operators: When you want to make quick decisions!
// Fun fact: Ternary operators can make code more concise but readability should always come first!
